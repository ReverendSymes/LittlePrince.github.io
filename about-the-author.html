    <p>Little Prince is written by a French aviator and writer, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry in 1943. His works are the unique testimony of a pilot who described adventure through a poet’s eyes. Through Little Prince, he aimed to give a gentle and grave reminder that the best things in life are still the simplest ones and that real wealth is giving to others.</p>
