    <p>Little Prince is written by a French aviator and writer, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, in 1943. His works are the unique testimony of a pilot who described adventure through a poet’s eyes. Through Little Prince, he aimed to give a gentle and grave reminder that the best things in life are still the simplest ones and that genuine wealth is giving to others. Saint-Exupéry found both a source for heroic action and a new literary theme in aviation. Many of his works value adventure as the highest realization of an individual's purpose in life.</p>
