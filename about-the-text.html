    <p>The Little Prince is a story of the encounter of a pilot, who has crashed in the African desert, and a little prince, who himself has landed on earth far away from his planet which can be seen above as a small star. A would-be artist at six years of age, the pilot had that career thwarted by the lack of imagination of grown-ups who could not understand, without explanation, his drawing of a boa constrictor eating an elephant, making him conclude that they are incapable of recognizing importance in anything except what lies on the surface.</p>
    <p>

    </p>
      <p>The little prince, through the relating of his own problems, asking the pilot to draw him a sheep, awakens the pilot to his own restricted sense of what is important, inducing him to conclude that he too is now like the grown-ups. The prince speaks of his planet, with the baobab sprouts that he has to dig up every day lest they should take over the planet; he speaks with great passion of his special rose, the only one of its kind due to his dedication to its well-being regardless of its taunting. The little prince also relates his journey to earth, stopping on the way at different asteroids on which grown ups (a king, a businessman, and a drunkard among others), appear to him very strange because of their resolved application to things that are only quantifiable and have no ultimate purpose.</P>
        <p>

        </p>
      <p>He speaks of the time he spent with the fox, learning the art of taming and rites, which turns what is common into a unique relationship. The pilot learns to love the little prince, as the latter loves the rose. At the same time the pilot has repaired his plane, the little prince is also ready to return to his planet, through the elixir of a snakeâ€™s poison. Yet the separation is only physical, for taming creates bonds that endure through time and space, such that the stars they each gaze upon will remind them of each other.</p>
