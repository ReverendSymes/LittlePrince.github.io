    <p>The cultural impact of The Little Prince has been immense. This includes:
      Addresses themes of loneliness, friendship, love, and loss
  Makes many observations about life, adults and human nature
  This is one of the reasons people will often reread it many times and take away different things based on the stage they are at in life - causing it to be so acclaimed and loved by many
  Selling an estimated 140 million copies globally, the little prince is one of the best-selling and most translated books ever published - being translated in over 301 languages and dialects
  It has also been adapted into various other art forms and media, such as audio, film, ballet, opera, and more.
  The initial reception of this book was one of bewilderment due to the unconventional multi-layered story lines, morals, and ambiguous genre (being neither a children’s or adult book).
  One New York Herald Tribune review from the author of Mary Poppins claims “The Little Prince will shine upon children with a sidewise gleam. It will strike them in some place that is not the mind and glow there until the time comes for them to comprehend it.”
  Another review from The American Conservative claims “[it provides a] bird's eye view of humanity [and] contains some of the most profound observations on the human condition ever written”
  The book has become a cultural icon, selling almost 2 million copies annually and continuously inspiring many adaptations.
