    <p>The cultural impact of The Little Prince has been immense. Its addressing <br>
    of themes of loneliness, friendship, love, and loss, and observations about <br>
    life, adults and human nature means that people will often reread it many times <br>
    and take away different things based on the stage they are at in life, <br>
    causing it to be so acclaimed and loved by many <br><br>

  Selling an estimated 140 million copies globally, the little prince is one of <br>
  the best-selling and most translated books ever published - being translated <br>
  into over 301 languages and dialects. <br>
  It has also been adapted into various other art forms and media, such as audio, <br>
  film, ballet, opera, and more. The initial reception of this book was one of bewilderment <br>
  due to the unconventional multi-layered story lines, morals, and ambiguous genre <br>
  (being neither a children’s or adult book). One New York Herald Tribune review from <br>
  the author of Mary Poppins claims “The Little Prince will shine upon children with a <br>
  sidewise gleam. It will strike them in some place that is not the mind and glow there <br>
  until the time comes for them to comprehend it.” Another review from The American Conservative <br>
  claims “[it provides a] bird's eye view of humanity [and] contains some of the most profound <br>
  observations on the human condition ever written” The book has become a cultural icon, <br>
  selling almost 2 million copies annually and continuously inspiring many adaptations. <br><br>
